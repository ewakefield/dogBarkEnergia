dogBarkEnergia
==============

My dog tends to bark a lot when I leave the apartment. I decided to build a quick application to help me track how much she barks while I'm gone so I can assess what to do.   The application is built using Texas Instruments LaunchPad, CC3100 BoosterPack and the new Grove Module Boosterpack! The code leverages the exposed API's of Twilio and Google Drive through the use of Temboo! 

To install this, download the folder, unzip and rename the folder inside of the master folder from dogBarkEnergia-master to just dogbark
Drag this file into your ~/Energia where the rest of your projects are and place it there. 
Go into the folder and double click dogbar.ino and it will open energia
Once open, you will need to go to temboo and provide your own application keys and account info, wifi ssid and passwords, and twilio and gmail profile information.

Enjoy! :)
